# IMDb Clone - React Project

This project is an IMDb clone built with React.js. The project utilizes CSS for styling various components and pages.

## Project Structure

- `public/`: Contains the static files such as `index.html`.
- `src/`: Contains the main React application files.
  - `components/`: Directory for reusable React components.
    - Each component has its own directory containing a JavaScript file for the component logic and a CSS file for the component styling.
    - For example, a `Card` component would have `Card.js` and `Card.css`.
  - `pages/`: Directory for page-specific components.
    - Each page has its own directory containing a JavaScript file for the page logic and a CSS file for the page styling.
    - For example, a `HomePage` would have `HomePage.js` and `HomePage.css`.
  - `App.js`: Main React component that serves as the entry point of the application.
  - `App.css`: CSS file for styling the main `App` component.
  - `index.js`: Entry point for the React application.
  - `index.css`: Global CSS file for general styling applied across the entire application.


 CSS Styling
Component CSS:
Each component within the components directory has a corresponding CSS file for its specific styling.
This helps in maintaining modularity and makes it easier to manage styles for individual components.
Page CSS:
Each page within the pages directory has a corresponding CSS file for its specific styling.
This approach keeps page-specific styles organized and contained within their respective directories.
Global CSS:
General styles that apply to the entire application are defined in the index.css file.
The App.css file contains styles specific to the main App component.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
